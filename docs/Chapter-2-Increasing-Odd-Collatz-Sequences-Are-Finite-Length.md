# Chapter 2 - Increasing Odd-Collatz Subsequences Are Finite Length

In [Chapter 1](Chapter-1-Unbounded-Length-Increasing-Odd-Collatz-Sequences.md) we introduced the definition of _Odd-Collatz_ sequences and proved the result that there are monotonically increasing Odd-Collatz subsequences of arbitrarily length.

In this chapter we will show that although there is no upper bound on the length of a monotonically increasing Odd-Collatz subsequence, all monotonically increasing Odd-Collatz subsequences are finite length.

## Lemma 2B

The Odd-Collatz (sub)sequence $`n_0, f_o(n_0), f_o(f_o(n_0)), \dots, f_o^{i}(n_0)`$ where $`i > 1` is monotonically increasing _iff_ $`n_0 = 2^{i+1}m^{'} + 2^{i+1} - 1`$ for some $`m^{'} \gteq 0`$.
